# Introduction  

This is a project that focuses on Graph theory and Asynchronous Programming using JavaScript.

## Description 

This project consists of several simple scripts :

1. Node Class 

This Class presents the fundemantal component of the project , it creates the nodes giving every node specific properties, like name, duration, start, finish, url, and other properties that can be used later on in the code.

3. GraphClean

This Script Uses the previous Node Class and adds on it by creating the edges between the created nodes and adds some functionalities, like finding durations or names , assigning parent or releasing parents, or executing the graph with different methods.

5. Main

Where the magic happens, after creating a subtraction layer, we bring the necessary classes and create our script using a JSON File to read from the keys and values and create our graph that will be later on executed.

7. Prototype

For adding new features without messing with the old code to try and make as independant as possible so the code becomes more flexible and reusable.
